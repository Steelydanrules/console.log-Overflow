# README - console.log Overflow
![show-image](app/assets/images/ScrollLogo.png)

**The Basics:**
console.log Overflow is a clone of one of the most essential websites for any programmer: Stack Overflow. Similar to Stack Overflow, a user can create an account, post questions, post answers, vote on questions, search, & browse questions/answers. Feel free to create an account and post or browse (the very insightful questions) on my clone.

**Live Site:**
